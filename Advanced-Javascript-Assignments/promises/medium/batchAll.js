// Problem Description – batchAll(tasks, batchSize)

// You are required to implement a function named batchAll that processes an array of asynchronous tasks in fixed-size batches. 
// Each batch should execute its tasks concurrently, but the next batch must not start until all tasks in the current batch have completed.
async function batchAll(tasks, batchSize) {
    const results = [];

    for(let i = 0; i < tasks.length ; i += batchSize){
        const batches = tasks.slice(i,i+batchSize);
        const promises = batches.map(task => task());
        const batchResult = await Promise.all(promises);

        results.push(...batchResult);
    }

    return results;
}

module.exports = batchAll;
