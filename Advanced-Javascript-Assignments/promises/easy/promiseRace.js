// Problem Description – Custom Implementation of Promise.race

// You are required to implement your own version of Promise.race without using the built-in method. 
// The function should accept an iterable of values that may include Promises or plain values. 
// It must settle as soon as the first input settles, resolving or rejecting accordingly. 
// Using Promise.resolve ensures non-promise values are handled correctly.
function promiseRace(promises) {
    return new Promise((resolve,reject) => {
        for(const p of promises){
            Promise.resolve(p)
                    .then(resolve)
                    .catch(reject);
        }
    })
}

module.exports = promiseRace;
