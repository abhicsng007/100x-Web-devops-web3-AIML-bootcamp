// Problem Description – Asynchronous Worker Pool
//
// You are required to create a worker pool that manages the execution
// of asynchronous tasks.
// The pool should ensure that no more than N tasks are running concurrently,
// while any additional tasks are queued.
// As tasks complete, queued tasks should start automatically.
// Each task must invoke its callback with its result when finished.

    this.limit = 0;
    this.active = 0;

    this._next();
